# SQL Financial Statements


## Description
After three weeks of learning during my master's degree, I utilized my SQL knowledge to structure P&L and B/S statements. The project involved analyzing the structure and content of the H_Accounting database and developing queries to retrieve the required information. The results were then inserted into temporary tables through a meticulously designed stored procedure.
Within three weeks of studying SQL for my master's degree, I applied my knowledge to structure Profit and Loss (P&L) and Balance Sheet (B/S) statements. Leveraging data from the accounting database H_Accounting and the Rosas Palas case, I formulated queries to extract the necessary information and populate temporary tables via a stored procedure.

To successfully execute the task, the stored procedure was designed to accept a year as an argument. It performed calculations to determine the net profit or loss and utilized this value to generate well-organized result grids for both the P&L and B/S statements. Each major account line item and section in the statements was accompanied by clear headings, enabling easy interpretation. This feature facilitates rapid assessment and offers valuable insights into financial performance.
